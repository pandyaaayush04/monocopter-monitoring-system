## IBM AI Builders Challenge 2026 — Submission

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| **Challenge Theme** | Agentic AI for Content Creation & Distribution |
| **Primary IBM Tool** | **IBM Bob** (AI Software Engineer) |
| **IBM AI Model** | **IBM Granite 3.0** (`ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct`) |
| **IBM Platform** | **IBM watsonx.ai** — Granite inference via HuggingFace |
| **Team** | Tanisha Sharma · Jeneesh Vandra |

## Problem Statement

Content creators face a **brutal production bottleneck**:

- A single 1-hour podcast or interview contains **dozens of viral moments** — but identifying them manually takes 4–8 hours of editing work.
- After clipping, creators must still **write titles, descriptions, hashtags**, generate **thumbnails**, create **B-roll visuals**, and **distribute** across 5+ platforms.
- Most AI tools solve **one** part of this workflow — forcing creators to juggle 6+ disconnected apps.
- **80% of creator time** is spent on repetitive post-production instead of making content.

> **Result:** Great content never gets made because the production pipeline is too slow and expensive.

---

## Solution Description

**TANI** is a fully integrated, AI-orchestrated content platform that takes a raw long-form video and **autonomously handles every stage** of the creator workflow:

```
Raw Video -> Transcription -> Viral Analysis -> 9:16 Clip Rendering
          -> Metadata Generation -> YouTube Publishing -> Done
```

Additionally:
- **Text-to-Image**: Generate B-roll visuals from a text prompt in seconds
- **AI Thumbnail Generator**: Create scroll-stopping YouTube thumbnails with one click

Everything lives in **one unified dark-themed platform** — no switching between tools.

### AI Pipeline — Step by Step

| Step | Technology | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Ingest | `yt-dlp` / File Upload | Download YouTube video or accept upload (up to 500MB) |
| 2. Transcribe | **Faster-Whisper** | Word-level timestamps with speaker detection |
| 3. Analyze | **IBM Granite 3.0** | LLM identifies top 5 viral segments, scores 0–100, generates hook text + script commentary |
| 4. Validate | `jsonschema` | Granite output validated against strict JSON Schema |
| 5. Diarize | **Pyannote.audio** | Speaker tracking for smart 9:16 crop positioning |
| 6. Render | **FFmpeg** | Trim + 9:16 crop + subtitle burn-in with karaoke timing |
| 7. Suggest | **IBM Granite** heuristics | Generate viral titles, descriptions, 30 hashtags |
| 8. Publish | **YouTube Data API v3** | Chunked resumable OAuth 2.0 upload -> live Shorts URL |

### IBM Granite 3.0 — Viral Analysis Prompt Strategy

IBM Granite 3.0 (`ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct`) is the **core intelligence** of TANI:

- Receives the full word-level transcript as structured JSON
- Returns **exactly 5 viral clips** with: `start_time`, `end_time`, `hook_text`, `script_commentary`, `virality_score` (0–100), `virality_reasoning`
- Strict **JSON-only output** — no markdown, no prose
- Output validated with `jsonschema` — retry with stricter prompt on failure
- `tenacity` exponential backoff for HuggingFace rate limits (3 attempts)
- Fallback to **local Ollama** via `USE_OLLAMA=true` config flag

## IBM Tools — Detailed Usage

### 1. IBM Bob (AI Software Engineer)

> **IBM Bob is the AI software engineer that built this entire project.**

**IBM Bob** (`bob.ibm.com`) was used as the **primary development tool** throughout the entire project lifecycle:

#### What IBM Bob Built:
- Complete FastAPI backend — all 8 service modules, 3 API route files, Pydantic models, JSON schemas, pytest test suite
- Full Next.js frontend — landing page, video studio, text-to-image workspace, thumbnail generator, all 50+ React components
- YouTube OAuth 2.0 flow — complete Google OAuth integration with popup window, token exchange, chunked resumable upload
- IBM Granite integration — prompt engineering, JSON schema validation, retry logic with tenacity
- FFmpeg pipeline — 9:16 smart crop, subtitle burn-in, speaker-aware framing with Pyannote
- UI/UX integration — merged design system with functional backend, dark theme, all color tokens
- Bug fixes — resolved `httplib2` Windows redirect bug, Next.js Server/Client component split, dark theme visibility issues
- Git & deployment — `.gitignore`, secrets audit, README, GitHub push

#### IBM Bob's Coding Environment — Proof of Build

<img src="docs/screenshots/coding-environment.png" alt="IBM Bob Coding Environment — Building TANI" width="100%"/>

> *Every component, API route, and service module was written inside IBM Bob's native coding environment shown above.*

#### IBM Bob's Development Approach:
IBM Bob followed a **spec-driven, sequential implementation** plan (`tasks.md`) with:
- Modular service architecture (each service is independently testable)
- Type-safe TypeScript interfaces mirroring Pydantic models exactly
- Clean error handling at every layer (HTTP status codes, typed exceptions)
- Zero TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean)

---

### 2. IBM Granite 3.0

**Model:** `ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct` via **IBM watsonx.ai / HuggingFace Inference API**

**Role:** Core viral intelligence engine

```python
# How IBM Granite 3.0 is used in TANI
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(model="ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-instruct")

# Granite receives the full transcript and returns structured viral clips
response = client.text_generation(
    prompt=_build_prompt(transcript),  # system + user prompt
    max_new_tokens=2048,
    temperature=0.2,                   # low temp for consistent JSON
)
# Output: {"clips": [{rank, start_time, end_time, hook_text, virality_score, ...}]}
```

**Granite handles:**
- Identifying the most engaging 30–60 second segments
- Scoring emotional impact and virality potential (0–100)
- Writing the "hook" — the opening line that makes viewers stop scrolling
- Explaining *why* each segment will go viral

## Selected Challenge Theme — July 2026

> ### 🎨 Reimagine Creative Industries with AI

AI is transforming how people create content, tell stories, design experiences, and bring ideas to life. TANI is our direct answer to this challenge — a fully agentic platform that reimagines every stage of the creator workflow, making professional-quality content production accessible to anyone with an idea.

---

### How can AI enhance creativity?

Traditional content creation demands that creators split their attention across dozens of repetitive, technical tasks — transcribing footage, cutting clips, writing titles, generating visuals, and distributing across platforms. TANI removes all of that friction.

By delegating the **technical layer entirely to AI**, creators reclaim their most valuable resource: creative focus. IBM Granite 3.0 doesn't just cut clips — it reads the emotional arc of a conversation, identifies the moment a story peaks, writes the hook that makes someone stop scrolling, and explains *why* that moment will resonate. The creator's voice and vision are amplified, not replaced.

- **AI-generated hooks** — Granite writes the opening line that captures attention in the first 3 seconds
- **Virality scoring** — Each clip is rated 0–100 with detailed reasoning, giving creators data-driven creative intuition
- **AI thumbnails** — FLUX.1-schnell generates scroll-stopping visuals from a platform-aware, style-aware prompt
- **Text-to-image B-roll** — Any scene a creator can describe in words, TANI renders as a cinematic image in seconds

---

### How can AI help people create faster?

A single 1-hour interview contains dozens of publishable moments. Manually finding them, cutting them to 9:16, writing metadata, and distributing them takes **4–8 hours per video**. TANI compresses that to **under 5 minutes** — an 80%+ time reduction.

The full pipeline is autonomous end-to-end:

| Step | Without TANI | With TANI |
|---|---|---|
| Transcription | 1–2 hrs manual review | < 60 sec — Faster-Whisper auto |
| Viral clip identification | 2–4 hrs scrubbing footage | < 30 sec — IBM Granite analysis |
| 9:16 rendering + captions | 1–2 hrs in editing software | < 2 min — FFmpeg pipeline |
| Titles, descriptions, hashtags | 30–60 min copywriting | < 10 sec — Granite metadata |
| YouTube publishing | Manual upload + form fill | One click — OAuth 2.0 API |
| **Total** | **4–8 hours** | **< 5 minutes** |

TANI demonstrates agentic speed through:

1. **Multi-step autonomy** — The pipeline runs from raw video to live YouTube URL with minimal human input
2. **Tool orchestration** — Whisper, Granite, FFmpeg, Pyannote, and YouTube API work as coordinated, specialized agents
3. **Self-validation** — Granite output is validated against a strict JSON schema; on failure, the agent retries automatically with a stricter prompt
4. **Adaptive routing** — Falls back to local Ollama if the cloud API is unavailable — zero downtime for creators
5. **Cross-platform distribution** — One clip, instantly formatted for YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn, and X

---

### How can AI unlock entirely new creative experiences?

TANI opens creative doors that simply didn't exist before:

- **Any creator can go viral** — You no longer need a professional editor or years of craft knowledge to produce platform-native short-form content. TANI's AI identifies the best moments even when the creator can't see them yet.
- **Real-time visual storytelling** — The text-to-image workspace lets creators generate B-roll, concept art, and visual metaphors from a single sentence — images that would require a full design team or stock licensing.
- **AI-generated thumbnails with brand intelligence** — The thumbnail generator understands platform context (YouTube vs. LinkedIn vs. Reels), visual style, mood, and facial expression — producing assets that used to take 30 minutes in Photoshop in under 10 seconds.
- **Speaker-aware cinematography** — Pyannote diarization combined with FFmpeg smart cropping means the camera follows the active speaker automatically, bringing broadcast-level production quality to amateur footage.
- **From idea to live video in one platform** — No switching between tools. The entire creative pipeline — from raw upload to live YouTube Shorts URL — happens inside a single, unified dark-themed workspace.

> TANI doesn't just make existing workflows faster. It makes *entirely new creative workflows possible* — for solo creators, small teams, and anyone who has a story to tell but not the time or resources to tell it professionally.
