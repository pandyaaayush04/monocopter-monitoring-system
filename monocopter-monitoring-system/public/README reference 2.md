## 🇮🇳 Smart India Hackathon 2026: Problem Statement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem Statement ID** | 26167 |
| **Problem Statement Title** | SatQuery AI - An Interactive Vision-Language Assistant for Multimodal Remote Sensing Image Analysis through Text Queries |
| **Organization** | Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) |
| **Department** | Department of Space / Indian Space Research Organisation |
| **Category** | Software |
| **Theme** | Space Technology |

### Description

**Background**
Remote-sensing imagery is widely used for agricultural monitoring, disaster management, urban planning, forest monitoring, water-resource assessment, infrastructure mapping, and environmental analysis. However, most existing remote-sensing AI solutions are developed as isolated applications for a single predefined task, such as land-cover classification, object detection, visual question answering, or change detection. These systems often require users to understand satellite-data characteristics, GIS workflows, model selection, and task-specific parameters. Consequently, non-expert users may find it difficult to obtain meaningful information from satellite imagery through simple natural-language queries.

Many operational remote-sensing questions cannot always be answered reliably using a single optical image. Relevant information may be distributed across paired or multiple observations acquired at different times or by different sensors. Optical and multispectral imagery provides spectral and contextual information, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides complementary structural information and supports day-and-night acquisition through cloud cover. Multitemporal image pairs are required to identify and interpret changes over time, while co-registered optical–SAR pairs can provide more complete and reliable information than either modality alone.

A general-purpose large language model (LLM) or vision-language model (VLM) cannot be expected to perform these specialised tasks reliably without adaptation to remote-sensing imagery, sensor characteristics, and domain-specific terminology. The proposed solution must therefore include remote-sensing fine-tuning or domain adaptation and may employ multiple specialised models for different tasks. BigEarthNet.txt will serve as the primary dataset for adapting image–text representations to multisensor remote-sensing data. VRSBench and RSVQA will be used to evaluate single-image captioning, grounding, and visual question answering, while CDVQA will be used to evaluate multitemporal change-based visual question answering.

The novelty of SatQuery AI lies in its agentic, query-driven framework. Instead of applying a single generic VLM, the system selects and executes suitable remote-sensing specialist models, validates inputs, combines their outputs, and returns an evidence-grounded response.

**Description**
The objective is to develop SatQuery AI, a software-based agentic vision-language assistant for analysing single and paired remote-sensing images through natural-language queries. Single-image understanding is a mandatory baseline, while the principal focus is joint reasoning over paired cross-modal and multitemporal imagery.

**Defined Input Scope**

- **Single image:** One optical/multispectral or SAR image for captioning, visual question answering, and text-guided region grounding.
- **Cross-modal pair:** Co-registered optical/multispectral and SAR images of the same geographic area for joint information extraction and cross-modal analysis.
- **Bi-temporal pair:** Two spatially corresponding images of the same geographic area acquired at different times for change detection, change description, and change-based visual question answering.
- **Supported formats:** GeoTIFF or TIFF for geospatial imagery. PNG and JPEG inputs may be accepted only for the prescribed public benchmark datasets.

**Mandatory Functional Scope**

- **Remote-sensing adaptation:** At least one visual or vision-language component must be fine-tuned or otherwise adapted using BigEarthNet.txt or the any open source training data.
- **Single-image baseline:** Visual question answering shall be mandatory. Each solution must additionally implement either captioning/scene description or text-guided region grounding.
- **Multi-image change analysis:** Change description or change-based visual question answering from a bi-temporal image pair shall be mandatory. A spatial change map may also be generated where reference masks are available.
- **Cross-modal pair analysis:** The system must extract complementary information from a co-registered optical/multispectral and SAR image pair.
- **Agentic orchestration:** The system must automatically select, sequence, and execute the appropriate specialist models or tools according to the query and input configuration.

**Representative Queries**

- 'Describe the land-cover and major objects visible in this image.'
- 'Highlight the water body referred to in the query.'
- 'What changed between these two dates, and where did the change occur?'
- 'Use the optical and SAR images together to identify built-up and water-covered regions.'
- 'Has the built-up area increased, decreased, or remained unchanged?'

**Agentic Model and Tool Orchestration**
The system may use multiple specialised components, such as a remote-sensing VQA or captioning model, a grounding model, a change-understanding or change-VQA model, and an optical–SAR fusion or information-extraction model.

- interpret the query and classify the requested task;
- check the number, modality, format, metadata, and compatibility of the input images;
- select one or more models or tools from a predefined registry;
- configure only permitted task parameters and execute the selected workflow;
- combine textual and spatial outputs, estimate confidence, and return visual evidence; and
- provide an auditable execution summary containing the selected task, model/tool names, and key parameters.

The controller may perform internal task planning; however, only the observable execution trace, including the selected task, models or tools, permitted parameters, and outputs will be evaluated. Internal reasoning text is neither required nor evaluated.

**Expected Solution**
The expected solution is an interactive GUI or web application with an agentic remote-sensing AI backend. It should accept supported image inputs and natural-language queries, select the appropriate specialist workflow, and return evidence-grounded textual and visual results.

The solution should include:

- Input upload and compatibility checking.
- A remote-sensing-adapted vision-language component.
- Specialist tools for VQA, captioning or grounding, change understanding, and optical–SAR analysis.
- An agentic controller for task routing, tool execution, and output integration.
- Visual evidence, confidence information, execution summaries, and downloadable reports.

Each solution must demonstrate single-image VQA, one additional single-image task, multitemporal change understanding, optical–SAR paired-image analysis, and agentic model/tool orchestration. A generic LLM or VLM without remote-sensing adaptation will not satisfy the requirements.

**Deliverables**
An interactive GUI or web application with an agentic remote-sensing AI backend, Codes and models including test and demonstration.

**Implementation Scope**
The system shall support single optical/multispectral or SAR images, co-registered optical–SAR pairs, and bi-temporal pairs in GeoTIFF/TIFF or approved benchmark formats. It must perform single-image VQA, one additional single-image task, change analysis, optical–SAR joint analysis, and agentic model/tool selection through an interactive GUI or web application.

**Evaluation/Judging Criteria**
Final evaluation will use prescribed public benchmark test subsets and an ISRO/SAC evaluation dataset. Scores will be normalised before combining different metrics.

Public benchmarks will be evaluated using the prescribed test splits. The ISRO/SAC evaluation set will contain pre-georeferenced and co-registered Cartosat-2S optical and RISAT SAR image pairs, with task-specific reference answers, labels, bounding boxes, or masks, as applicable. Evaluation annotations will not be disclosed to participating teams.

## The Problem We Are Solving

Satellites capture the whole planet every few days, but getting an answer out of that imagery is slow and needs specialists:

- Reading a satellite scene takes **trained GIS and remote-sensing experts**, so questions from planners, responders and administrators wait in a queue.
- General AI chatbots can *describe* an image, but they often answer **confidently even when the image does not support the claim**. That is unsafe for disaster response, land monitoring or defence.
- Real users often have **only one sensor**: optical is blocked by cloud or night, and radar (SAR) is hard for non-experts to read.
- Most tools give a sentence and **no evidence**, so a reviewer cannot check how the answer was reached.

> **Result:** Valuable Earth-observation data goes unused because asking a simple question of it is too slow, too technical, and too hard to trust.

---

## Solution Description

**SatQuery AI** lets anyone ask a plain-language question about a satellite image (one scene, an optical + radar pair, or a before/after pair) and get an answer that is **checked against the sensor data itself**, comes with a **confidence level**, and says *"I can't verify this"* when the evidence is not enough.

```
Image(s) + question -> Preflight validation -> Task routing
        -> Physics engine / Change engine / Vision-language model
        -> Cross-check + confidence -> Answer with a plain-language trace
```

Everything lives in one chat interface:

- **Single image:** what is in it, where things are, how much water or greenery
- **Optical + SAR fusion:** combine a normal image and a radar image of the same place
- **Before / after change:** what changed between two dates, and where
- **Name a place:** type "land cover around Pune" and live Sentinel-2 imagery is fetched for you

### AI Pipeline: Step by Step

| Step | Technology | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Ingest | GeoTIFF upload / live place fetch | Upload 1-2 GeoTIFFs, or name a place and fetch fresh Sentinel-2 imagery |
| 2. Preflight | `rasterio` | Checks real georeferencing, sensor type, footprint overlap, resolution and acquisition time |
| 3. Route | Rule-based router | Classifies the question: change, fusion, open question, caption or grounding |
| 4. Verify | **Physics engine** | Water, vegetation and built-up questions are answered from NDWI / NDVI / NDBI and SAR thresholds |
| 5. Compare | **Change engine** | Per-pixel change with a noise-robust threshold; regions, size, direction and land-cover trends |
| 6. Understand | **Qwen3-VL-4B + QLoRA** | Captions, open questions and bounding boxes; its answer is cross-checked against the physics result |
| 7. Score | Confidence rules | Agreement is high, disagreement is low, model-only is moderate, no evidence means abstain |
| 8. Explain | Audit trace | The answer arrives with the steps taken, in plain language |

## 🧠 Models Used

SatQuery AI uses **one fine-tuned vision-language model** and **two deterministic science engines**. The model handles what only a model can (description, open questions, locating things). The engines answer the factual questions from the sensor signal itself.

### 1. Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct: Vision-Language Model

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` |
| **Role** | Captioning, open visual Q&A, bounding-box grounding, and open chat |
| **Precision** | 4-bit NF4 quantization (`bitsandbytes`), fits on a 6 GB laptop GPU |
| **Loaded** | Lazily in a background thread, so the app answers sensor-only questions while it warms up |

```python
# How the model is loaded in SatQuery AI (satquery/vlm.py)
model = AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map={"": 0},
    quantization_config=BitsAndBytesConfig(
        load_in_4bit=True,
        bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
        bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
        llm_int8_skip_modules=["visual", "lm_head"],
    ),
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path)  # the QLoRA adapter
```

### 2. SatQuery QLoRA Adapter: Fine-tuned for Earth Observation

The base model is fine-tuned with **QLoRA** (a small trained adapter on the frozen 4-bit model) so it answers in the exact formats each task needs: one word for yes/no, a letter for multiple choice, a normalised box for grounding, and a fluent sentence for captions. 

*Architecture*: The model targets both the **language projection layers** (`q/k/v/o_proj`, etc.) as well as the **visual merger layers** (`linear_fc1` & `linear_fc2`). Adapting the visual layers directly allowed the model to achieve a massive improvement in spatial understanding and bounding-box grounding accuracy.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Method** | QLoRA (LoRA adapter on a 4-bit base) |
| **LoRA Rank (r) & Alpha** | Rank: 32, Alpha: 64, Dropout: 0.05 |
| **Target Modules** | Language model projections + Visual merger layers |
| **Training data** | **BigEarthNet.txt** (51k rows): BigEarthNet v2 Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) patches with a question-answer layer |
| **Tasks** | Captioning · yes/no · multiple choice · bounding-box grounding |
| **Coverage** | 10 countries · 4 seasons · 10 climate zones |
| **Modality robustness** | One sensor is randomly withheld during training, so it answers from optical only, radar only, or both |
| **Training compute** | Dual free Kaggle GPUs |

**Held-out benchmark results (500 questions per task type):**

| Task | Base model | With our adapter |
|---|---|---|
| Yes / no (accuracy) | 0.47 | **0.75** |
| Multiple choice (accuracy) | 0.01 | **0.67** |
| Bounding box (mean IoU) | 0.04 | **0.53** |
| Bounding box (accuracy at IoU 0.5) | 0.01 | **0.61** |
| Captioning (ROUGE-L) | 0.13 | **0.55** |

### 3. Physics Engine: Deterministic, No Model

| Concept | Signal |
|---|---|
| Water | **NDWI** from optical bands, and low radar backscatter |
| Vegetation | **NDVI** from red and near-infrared |
| Built-up area | **NDBI** from shortwave and near-infrared, and high radar backscatter |

Presence and absence questions are answered directly from these indices. When the model also answers, the two are compared: agreement keeps high confidence, disagreement is shown and lowers it.

### 4. Change-Detection Engine: Deterministic, No Model

Builds a per-pixel change signal from whichever sensor is present in both dates, thresholds it with a noise-robust statistic (median absolute deviation) so pure noise cannot register as change, then reports the largest changed regions with their size and direction, plus whether water, vegetation and built-up area went up or down.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed with **scrypt** and a per-user salt, never stored in plain text
- New accounts must **verify their email** with a 6-digit code (expires in 10 minutes, burnt after 5 wrong tries)
- Login, registration, verification and reset are **rate-limited**; error messages never reveal which emails have accounts
- Password rules: 8-128 characters, a letter and a number, not a common password
- Sessions are **signed HttpOnly cookies**
- No secrets are committed: `.env` files, the database and the cookie-signing key are git-ignored
